# Terminal Sokoban

Welcome to the Terminal Sokoban game! This is a basic clone (for now) of the classic puzzle game developed entirely in Rust and designed to be played in the terminal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To play the Rust Terminal Sokoban, you'll need:

- Rust installed on your machine. You can install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

### Installation

Clone the repository and build the game using Cargo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yarderyyz/termban.git
cd termban
cargo build --release

./target/release/termban
```
