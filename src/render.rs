/// Generates a `RenderGraph` from the provided `World` struct.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `world`: A reference to a `World` struct, which contains the game's state, including the board and entities.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// A `RenderGraph` struct that represents the entire scene to be rendered. The root node of the graph corresponds to
/// the game's board, and its children correspond to the entities present in the world.
///
/// # Details
///
/// This function creates a hierarchical `RenderGraph` that represents the current state of the game world. The root
/// node of the graph contains a `RenderItem::Board`, which represents the game board. The root node's children are
/// `RenderNode`s that each contain a `RenderItem::Entity`, representing the entities in the world. Each entity is
/// cloned from the `world` and encapsulated in a `RenderNode` without further children (i.e., `children` is `None`).
///
/// This graph structure allows for organized and flexible rendering of the game world. By constructing the scene
/// as a tree of `RenderNode`s, it becomes easier to traverse and render the scene in a systematic way, ensuring
/// that the board is rendered first, followed by the entities in the correct order.
///
/// This function is typically called before rendering to prepare the data needed to generate a visual representation
/// of the game state.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// let world = World::new(); // Assume World::new initializes a game world
/// let render_graph = generate_render_graph(&world);
///
/// // `render_graph` can now be passed to a rendering function
/// let area = Rect::new(0, 0, 80, 24); // Example rendering area
/// let glyph_buffer = glypherize_graph(render_graph, area, render_fn);
/// ```

/// # Details
///
/// Currently this method is pure function that takes a buffer and returns a new buffer.
/// This probably isn't how we want to do this long term but for now it's a simple approach.

/// buffer instead. And compare the performance of the pure functional approach to something

/// Takes a `RenderGraph` and renders it into a buffer for display
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `graph`: A `RenderGraph` struct, which represents the scene to render.
/// - `area`: A `Rect` specifying the area of the screen where the graph should be rendered.
/// - `render_fn`: A reference to a render fn takes an item and returns a new glyph_buffer.
///
/// # Details
///
/// This function serves as the entry point for rendering a complex scene represented by a `RenderGraph`
/// into a grid of cells (`GlyphCells`) that can be displayed on a terminal or another unicode grid-based rendering
/// system. The function starts by initializing an empty `GlyphCells` buffer with dimensions matching the
/// specified `area`. It then recursively traverses the nodes of the `RenderGraph`, applying the provided
/// `render_fn` to each `RenderItem` encountered. The `render_fn` is responsible for rendering each individual
/// item onto the `GlyphCells` buffer. Currently this is a purely functional process. In the future
/// this should be replaced with a mutable model for performance reasons.
///
/// The final `GlyphCells` buffer, containing the fully rendered scene, is returned to the caller. This
/// approach allows for flexible rendering strategies by passing different `render_fn` implementations
/// depending on the desired rendering behavior (e.g., rendering at different resolutions, applying
/// different styles, etc.).

/// Implements the `Widget` trait for the `GameWindow` struct, allowing it to be rendered within
/// a specified area on the screen using a given buffer. The rendering is performed based on the
/// zoom level of the game, with different rendering strategies applied depending on the selected zoom.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `area`: A `Rect` that defines the portion of the screen where the game window should be rendered.
/// - `buf`: A mutable reference to a `Buffer`, which will be used to store the rendered output.
///
/// # Details
///
/// - The method begins by generating a `RenderGraph` from the current state of the game world.
///   TODO: this should be reworked so that the render graph is only updated when the scene changes.
/// - Based on the zoom level (`Close`, `Middle`, or `Far`), the appropriate rendering function
///   (`render_4`, `render_2`, or `render_1`) is selected and applied to convert the `RenderGraph`
///   into a `GlyphCells` buffer.
/// - The `GlyphCells` buffer is then iterated over, and each `GlyphCell` in the buffer is drawn onto
///   the `buf` at the corresponding coordinates within the specified `area`.
/// - If a `CharPixel` has a foreground color (`fg`) or background color (`bg`), these colors are
///   applied to the respective cells in the buffer.
///
/// # Notes
///
/// - The method handles the precision loss clippy warning using `#[allow(clippy::cast_precision_loss)]`,
///   which is relevant when converting `usize` values (used for indexing) to `u16` for setting buffer coordinates.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// let mut buffer = Buffer::empty(Rect::new(0, 0, 80, 25));
/// let game_window = GameWindow::new(world);
/// game_window.render(Rect::new(0, 0, 80, 25), &mut buffer);
